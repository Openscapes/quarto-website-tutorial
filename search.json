    "text": "_quarto.yml\nLet’s have a closer look at the _quarto.yml file.\nThis type of file (.yml or .yaml) is written in YAML (“Yet Another Markup Language”). You’ll be able to shift the arrangement of webpages by reordering/adding/deleting them in the _quarto.yml file following the patterns you see in this example. As you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters. Pay attention to whether text is indented by one, two, four, or other spaces, and make sure you follow it; if your site is not looking as expected it is likely a silent error in your YAML. Some text editors like RStudio provide debugging support for YAML and are highly recommended to save you time and heartache.\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml and website side-by-side\n\n\nNotice that there are multiple ways in the _quarto.yml for you to include a file in your website. For example, in the above image, the “First Observations” we see in the left sidebar of the published website (right image) is represented in _quarto.yml (left image) over two lines, with line 36 indicating the file reference and line 37 indicating the text to show up in the left sidebar. However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar)."

This tutorial was originally created for several different audiences: NASA-Openscapes researcher support engineers using Python, communications directors at organizations promoting open science who do not identify as coders, and fisheries scientists curious about transitioning from RMarkdown. We’re hoping it’s useful to folks with backgrounds as wide as these; if you find it useful or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know by clicking “Edit this page” or “Report an issue” at the upper right side of any page.\nThe structure of this tutorial follows a previous one: Making free websites with RStudio’s RMarkdown."

See https://github.com/r-lib/actions for more details and examples.\n\nDownload instead of fork\nForking might not always be the way to go - you can’t fork into the same GitHub user account or organization so if for example you want to make a copy of 2021-Cloud-Hackathon repo within the same NASA-Openscapes GitHub Organization, you’ll need to download instead of fork.

When it downloads on your computer, unzip the files.\n\n\nCreate a new GitHub repo\nNavigate to your GitHub account or organization, and create a new repository, naming it what you’d like. You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username). When you’re logged in, github.com will show a green button that says “New” which you’ll also see as you navigate to your username’s repository page.\n\n\nAdd template site files\nTo use the GitHub file uploader, click the button next to the green “Code” button that says “Add file”. Add file > Upload files. Then, on your computer, select all the files in unzipped folder (command-A or control-A), and drag them to the GitHub uploader page. Scroll down to write a commit message, which effectively saves your files when you’re working in the browser.\nNote: if you’re comfortable cloning the new repository and copying files into it locally before committing and pushing back to GitHub, that can be preferable to the uploader, which does have limitations with complex repos (although the uploader works fine with this tutorial repo).\n\n\nSet up GitHub publishing\nIf you’ve used the GitHub uploader, you are not quite set up for publishing. We’ll do this in a few steps: we’ll set up a GitHub Action within your repo, and create a gh-pages branch.\nFirst, the GitHub Action. Go back to your main view of your GitHub repository by clicking on the name of your repository in blue at the top-left (the url in your browser window should say https://github.com/username/repo-name).\nNext to the green code button, click Add file > Create new file. Name it exactly this: .github/workflows/quarto-render.yml\nStart by typing the . with github and when you type the / it will give you a new text box to type workflows (plural!), then another /, and finally, quarto-render.yml.\nNow you’ll have an empty new file. Paste the following in this empty file - you can click on the top-right of this box to copy all the code inside this code box:\nname: Render and deploy quarto files\non: \n  push:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  quarto-render-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: \"Install Quarto and render project\"\n      uses: nasa-openscapes/quarto-render@v0.9.46 \n\n    - name: \"Deploy to gh-pages\"\n      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n      with:\n        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        publish_dir: ./_site\nCommit this to save your new quarto-render.yml file. This is your GitHub Action.\nNext, we’ll create a new gh-pages branch. Go back to the main view of your GitHub repository. On the far left from the green “Code” button, click the button that says “main”. In the pull-down menu, type gh-pages - all lowercase, with a hyphen. Click the bold text that says “Create branch: gh-pages from main”.\nNow click on the Settings tab in the top right of your repository. On the left sidebar, click Pages. At the top of Pages under “Source”, select gh-pages root, and press Save. You’ll then see a green highlighted text saying that your site is published at a “github.io” url ."
