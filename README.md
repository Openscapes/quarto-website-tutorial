# DfE Statistics Production Guidance

## Introduction

An rmarkdown website used as a central place to hold guidance, helpful links and code examples for statisticians working on Official Statistics at DfE. This is deployed via the DfE visual studio and rsconnect subscriptions. The source repository is hosted in Azure DevOps, though is also mirrored to GitHub after every update to the production environment. This mirror is then deployed via GitHub pages to provide a publicly accessible copy.
