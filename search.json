    "text": "Distill to quarto\nWe transitioned our events site from distill to quarto in May 2022 (github view before and after). We followed excellent notes and examples from Nick Tierney and Danielle Navarro.\nAfter we had changed all the files, the Build tab in the RStudio IDE still showed “Build website” rather then “Render Website” and “Preview Website”, and would error when we pushed them (because that button was expecting a distill site, not a quarto site). To fix this, we updated the .Rproj file. Clicking on the .Rproj file in the RStudio IDE will open a dialog box where you can click things you want (you can also open these in a text editor or from the GitHub website to see the actual text). To fix this situation with the Build tab: Project Options > Build Tools > Project Build Tools > None.\nLooking at files /posts/_metadata.yml and _quarto.yml helps see where things are defined. For example, to make event post citations appear, we added citation: true to /posts/_metadata.yml and in _quarto.yml under the website key we set site-url: https://openscapes.github.io/events. We deleted footer.html used with distill because footer is now defined in quarto.yml.\n\nPublishing notes\n\nBackground: Our distill site had been set up to output to a docs folder, and had GitHub Settings > Pages set to look there rather gh-pages branch. (Julie note: this was a new-to-me capability when we set up the events distill site in Spring 2021 so I had forgotten that was an option). We’ve inititally kept this same set-up for now with our events page in _quarto.yml: output-dir: docs. However, this is sub-optimal; better to not have to commit and push these files but to instead have a GitHub Action generate them upon a commit. So the following is what we did -\n\nDon’t specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _site/, which is what we’d like.\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder (like we did as we were experimenting), delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _site/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_site/\nPush these changes, merge into main.\nOn GitHub.com, in your repo, set up GitHub publishing\nFollow instructions from the getting started chapter."

You’ll be able to shift the arrangement of webpages by reordering/adding/deleting them in the _quarto.yml file following the patterns you see in this example. As you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters. Pay attention to whether text is indented by one, two, four, or other spaces, and make sure you follow it; if your site is not looking as expected it is likely a silent error in your YAML. Some text editors like RStudio provide debugging support for YAML and are highly recommended to save you time and heartache.\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml and website side-by-side\n\n\nNotice that there are multiple ways in the _quarto.yml for you to include a file in your website. For example, in the above image, the “First Observations” we see in the left sidebar of the published website (right image) is represented in _quarto.yml (left image) over two lines, with line 36 indicating the file reference and line 37 indicating the text to show up in the left sidebar. However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar)."

We’ll learn a few rules and look for patterns to get an understanding of what things do to help you start customizing and making it your own. And you can continue to use this website as a reference after the tutorial, along with Quarto documentation.\nWe’ll start our exploration online looking at the website architecture and GitHub repository. Then we’ll setup a copy for ourselves so that we can modify from a working example, which is a great way to learn something new. We’ll set it up so that any modifications (commits) will automatically be republished via GitHub Actions. Subsequent chapters will describe how to modify your repo using different tools (browser, RStudio, Jupyter)."

You can also click there from this page this tutorial website by clicking the GitHub octocat icon underneath the Openscapes logo in the left navbar (click it holding command on Mac, or control on a PC to open it in a different tab in your browser).\nHave a look at the filenames. We can recognize the names of the webpages we’ve seen above, and they have red arrows marking them in the image below. You’ll see the “quarto-workflows” folder and the rest in this site are .qmd files, which are plain text Quarto files that can combine Markdown text with code. index.qmd is the home page. If you click inside “quarto-workflows” you’ll see a mix of filetypes!\n\n\n\nquarto-website-tutorial GitHub repository with files for webpages marked with red arrows\n\n\nThe _site folder has html files with names that should be familiar: they match the .    md files we were just exploring.

    "text": "Fork to your account\nLet’s start with an existing Quarto site and copy it into your space to edit. You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username).\nFirst, choose an existing website to copy. The simplest option is to start with this site: quarto-website-tutorial.\nOther options of potential interest:\n\n2021-Cloud-Hackathon\n2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop\nApproach-Guide\n\nNext, follow these steps to fork and setup your repo with GitHub Actions from Gavin Fay, using the repo you chose. These instructions will take ~5 minutes.\nNow you’ve got a copy of your repo of choice in your own GitHub account, and you’re set to start making your own edits. Your GitHub repo is set up with a GitHub Action that will use Quarto to rebuild and republish your site anytime you make a commit: committing will trigger the GitHub Action to rebuild and republish the book.\nNote that the GitHub Action for this book does not include R or Python so those will need to be added if your website relies on code. See https://github.com/r-lib/actions for more details and examples.\n\nDownload instead of fork\nForking might not always be the way to go - you can’t fork into the same GitHub user account or organization so if for example you want to make a copy of 2021-Cloud-Hackathon repo within the same NASA-Openscapes GitHub Organization, you’ll need to download instead of fork. In this case, follow these steps to download and copy into a new repository, and set up the GitHub Action separately.\n\nDownload github repo files\nNavigate to https://github.com/openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial (or any other quarto site repo of choice). Click the green “Code” button and select “Download ZIP”. When it downloads on your computer, unzip the files.\n\n\nCreate a new GitHub repo\nNavigate to your GitHub account or organization, and create a new repository, naming it what you’d like. You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username). When you’re logged in, github.com will show a green button that says “New” which you’ll also see as you navigate to your username’s repository page.\n\n\nAdd original site files\nTo use the GitHub file uploader, click the button next to the green “Code” button that says “Add file”. Add file > Upload files. Then, on your computer, select all the files in unzipped folder (command-A or control-A), and drag them to the GitHub uploader page. Scroll down to write a commit message, which effectively saves your files when you’re working in the browser.\nNote: if you’re comfortable cloning the new repository and copying files into it locally before committing and pushing back to GitHub, that can be preferable to the uploader, which does have limitations with complex repos (although the uploader works fine with this tutorial repo).\n\n\nSet up GitHub publishing\nIf you’ve used the GitHub uploader, you are not quite set up for publishing. We’ll do this in a few steps: we’ll set up a GitHub Action within your repo, and create a gh-pages branch.\nFirst, the GitHub Action. Go back to your main view of your GitHub repository by clicking on the name of your repository in blue at the top-left (the url in your browser window should say https://github.com/username/repo-name).\nNext to the green code button, click Add file > Create new file. Name it exactly this: .github/workflows/quarto-render.yml\nStart by typing the . with github and when you type the / it will give you a new text box to type workflows (plural!), then another /, and finally, quarto-render.yml.\nNow you’ll have an empty new file. Paste the following in this empty file - you can click on the top-right of this box to copy all the code inside this code box:\nname: Render and deploy quarto files\non: \n  push:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  quarto-render-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: \"Install Quarto\"\n      uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/install-quarto@main\n      with:\n        version: 0.9.105\n      \n    - name: \"Quarto render\"\n      shell: bash\n      run: |\n        quarto render --execute-debug      \n        \n    - name: \"Deploy to gh-pages\"\n      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n      with:\n        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        publish_dir: ./_site\nCommit this to save your new quarto-render.yml file. This is your GitHub Action.\nNext, we’ll create a new gh-pages branch. Go back to the main view of your GitHub repository. On the far left from the green “Code” button, click the button that says “main”. In the pull-down menu, type gh-pages - all lowercase, with a hyphen. Click the bold text that says “Create branch: gh-pages from main”.\nNow click on the Settings tab in the top right of your repository. On the left sidebar, click Pages. At the top of Pages under “Source”, select gh-pages root, and press Save. You’ll then see a green highlighted text saying that your site is published at a “github.io” url ."
