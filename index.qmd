This website is a guide aimed at anyone producing official statistics in the Department for Education (DfE). It covers wider best practice and pulls together pieces of guidance that were previously standalone documents. If viewed in its entirety, it provides a walk-through guide from processing to publication, as well as being a single reference point that is easy to navigate if you just need to check on a specific part of the process, link off to other resources, or access specific guidance.

There is already a wealth of resources out there, and therefore this site unashamedly aims to pool the relevant resources for statistics production into one place. There are some things that this site does not yet have, it will develop and change over time. We hope it can prove a useful resource for everyone from the most experienced of producers, right through to those who are working on their very first publication. If you have any feedback, suggested additions, or wish to challenge any of the guidance, please contact us using the envelope button in the top right corner.
